This client contains more plugins featuring both rage and legit sytles.

## Dependencies

Based on Abengido:

- [Abendigo](https://github.com/Jire/Abendigo) The actual client for which IntrepidClient is made
- [Arrowhead](https://github.com/Jire/Arrowhead) for high-level interfacing with processes
- [Java Native Access (JNA)](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) as the backbone for interfacing with native libraries
- [Netty](http://netty.io) for Abendigo's networking

## Building from source

To run IntrepidClient first run "Build-Rebuild.bat", this compiles the client. Once both the hacks themselves and the menu are complete you run use the hacks by starting CS:GO and running "Launcher.bat".
