This client contains more plugins featuring both rage and legit sytles.

## Dependencies

Based on Abengido:

- [Abendigo](https://github.com/Jire/Abendigo) The actual client from which IntrepidClient is made
- [Arrowhead](https://github.com/Jire/Arrowhead) for high-level interfacing with processes
- [Java Native Access (JNA)](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) as the backbone for interfacing with native libraries
- [Netty](http://netty.io) for Abendigo's networking

## Building from source

To run IntrepidClient first run "run.bat" in each file, this compiles the client. Once both the hacks themselves and the menu are complete you can then run the hacks by starting CS:GO and run "abendigo.bat" as admin which is in "./IntrepidClient/build/install/abendigo/bin/" then run "abendigo-controller.bat" which is in "./IntrepidClient-menu/build/install/abendigo-controller/bin/".
